<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About The Project

![product-screenshot](https://github.com/mevid93/credex/blob/main/images/ui.png)

Credex is a lightweight password manager designed to securely store user credentials locally using AES-256-CBC encryption. While numerous robust password management solutions exist, Credex was developed as a personal project to explore the fundamentals of Qt framework and gain hands-on experience in building secure desktop applications.

## 🔑 Key Features

Credex offers a secure and user-friendly solution for managing passwords locally. Here’s what it brings to the table:

- 🧩 **Simple UI**  
  Designed with clarity and ease-of-use in mind, making credential management straightforward.

- 🔐 **AES-256-CBC Encryption**  
  All stored data is encrypted using industry-standard AES-256-CBC for robust security.

- 📁 **Encrypted Database Files (`.crdx`)**  
  Users can create and manage encrypted database files to store credentials securely.

- 💾 **Local Storage**  
  All data is saved locally on the user's device—no cloud, no external dependencies.

- ✏️ **Easy Editing**  
  Credentials can be added, modified, or deleted with minimal effort.
